- C# Design Pattern: Singleton
The singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern.

- Purpose
The purpose of the singleton design pattern is to ensure that a class only has one instance 
and provide a global point of access to it throughout the life of an application. 
Access of one instance is preferred to avoid unexpected results.
